### Theme Design

The theme is named Lukewarm to reflect its moderately warm, balanced aesthetic. Careful color choices reduce eye strain while maintaining vibrance. The slideshow spotlights top posts, and prominent newsletter CTAs help retain readers.

This is the existing [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) plus TypeScript.

wired with [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com).

We've used [Hashnode API's](https://apidocs.hashnode.com) and integrated them with this blog starter kit.

## Want to have your own?

Fork it and change the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_HOST` to your host (agrimawrites.hashnode.dev is the host in the example), `NEXT_PUBLIC_HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID` to your publication ID that you can get from dashboard URL (https://hashnode.com/YOUR_PUBLICATION_ID/dashboard) and deploy it to Vercel.
That's it! You now have your own frontend. You can still use Hashnode for writing your Articles.
